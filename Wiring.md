# Power to Coprocessors/LEDs/Router

VRM = Voltage Regulator Module
PDP = Power Distribution Panel

Raspi -  - 5V/2A - 2 Pin Power, 6 Pin Ground
ODroid - Power Supply off of 20 amp slot on PDP - 5V
Arduino - VRM - 5V/2A
Big LED Ring - PCM - Port 4 - Use a 12V converter off of the PCM since it outputs 24V
Small LED Ring - VRM - 12V/500mA
POE to Router - VRM - 12V/2A
Barrel Power to Router - VRM - 12V/2A
Ethernet Switch - USB off of RoboRIO - 5V
NavX - USB off of RoboRIO - 5V
