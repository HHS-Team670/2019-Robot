### Mustang-LEDS

Code for using an Arduino to interface with the RoboRIO over and Ethernet shield and receive commands for color changing LEDs


More on stuff like this can be found at [957's wiki](https://github.com/konkipstador/957-s-RoboLight/wiki)

### Hardware Components

* **ROBORIO** (duh)
* **AN ARDUINO with Ethernet.** This can be an Ethernet shield, or something like the Leonardo or Yun which has Ethernet port built in
* **ETHERNET SWITCH** for extra Ethernet ports, so you can use Ethernet on RoboRio both for all your necessities and the fancy lights too
* **NEOPIXEL LED STRIPS** (you can get them from Adafruit and other similar places)
